## Minimal, reproducible example
To help us resolve issues quickly, we need to be able to reproduce the problem on our end. The best way to do this is by providing a minimal example—one that isolates the issue as much as possible.

A minimal reproducible example does not necessarily mean using the fewest possible images. Instead, it means identifying what is causing the error. The issue might stem from the input data, but it could also be related to specific settings or configurations.

Your goal is to pinpoint the root cause so that we can recreate the problem. If the issue is caused by specific images, please send those images. However, if the problem arises due to certain settings (e.g., model A in mode B combined with setting C and D) and occurs regardless of the input data, there is no need to send images or videos—just provide the relevant settings.

By narrowing down the cause, you make it easier for us to diagnose and fix the issue efficiently.

Please follow these steps before to describe the bug so we can investigate:

1. Update AddaxAI
First, make sure you’re running the [latest version](https://addaxdatascience.com/addaxai/#install). The issue may already be fixed.

2. Identify the cause
* Does the issue happen after a specific sequence of button clicks?
* Does it involve a particular folder, image, or dataset?
* Can you minimize the problem? For example, does the error still occur with just one image or video?

3. Run AddaxAI in debug mode
Debug mode prints detailed error messages in a console window, which helps us pinpoint the issue. Instructions for running AddaxAI in debug mode, depending on your operating system, can be found [here](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI/blob/main/markdown/debug_mode.md). Once in debug mode, try to recreate the error so that a traceback appears in the console.

4. Send a detailed report
Once you’ve gathered the necessary details, [email us](url) with:

* A minimal reproducible example including required images/videos (the simplest way to trigger the error)
* Error logs from the debug console.
* This will help us quickly diagnose and fix the problem.

Thanks for helping us improve AddaxAI!
